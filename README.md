# Understanding and Building LLMs

Coursework on building LLMs from scratch. 

In the directory `reports` are the code materials referenced in the written reports submitted. 

- Report 1: Develop a simple data pre-processing pipeline
- Report 2: Pre-train a GPT-style LLM
- Report 3: Fine-tune the LLM
- Report 4: Evaluate the LLM

Everything else is a playground until I clean up in the end.
