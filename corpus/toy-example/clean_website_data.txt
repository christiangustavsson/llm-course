 computer security
 
 (also
 
 cybersecurity
 
 ,
 
 digital security
 
 , or
 
 information technology (it) security
 
 ) is a subdiscipline within the field of
 
 information security
 
 . it consists of the protection of
 
 computer software
 
 ,
 
 systems
 
 and
 
 networks
 
 from
 
 threats
 
 that can lead to unauthorized information disclosure, theft or damage to
 
 hardware
 
 ,
 
 software
 
 , or
 
 data
 
 , as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the
 
 services
 
 they provide.
 
 
 
 [

 ]
 
 
 
 
 
 
 [
 
 2
 
 ]
 
 
 
 
 
 the significance of the field stems from the expanded reliance on
 
 computer systems
 
 , the
 
 internet
 
 ,
 
 
 
 [

 ]
 
 
 
 and
 
 wireless network standards
 
 . its importance is further amplified by the growth of
 
 smart devices
 
 , including
 
 smartphones
 
 ,
 
 televisions
 
 , and the various devices that constitute the
 
 internet of things
 
 (iot). cybersecurity has emerged as one of the most significant new challenges facing the contemporary world, due to both the complexity of
 
 information systems
 
 and the societies they support. security is particularly crucial for systems that govern large-scale systems with far-reaching physical effects, such as
 
 power distribution

 vulnerabilities and attacks

 main article:
 
 vulnerability (computing)
 
 
 
 a vulnerability refers to a flaw in the structure, execution, functioning, or internal oversight of a computer or system that compromises its security. most of the vulnerabilities that have been discovered are documented in the
 
 common vulnerabilities and exposures
 
 (cve) database.
 
 
 
 [

 an
 
 exploitable
 
 vulnerability is one for which at least one working
 
 attack
 
 or
 
 
 exploit
 
 
 exists.
 
 
 
 [

 ]
 
 
 
 actors maliciously seeking vulnerabilities are known as
 
 
 threats
 
 
 . vulnerabilities can be reed, reverse-engineered, hunted, or exploited using
 
 automated tools
 
 or customized scripts.

 various people or parties are vulnerable to cyber attacks; however, different groups are likely to experience different types of attacks more than others.
 
 
 
 [
 
 10
 
 ]
 
 
 
 
 
 in april 2023, the
 
 united kingdom
 
 department for science, innovation & technology released a report on cyber attacks over the  12 months.
 
 
 
 [
 
 11
 
 ]
 
 
 
 they surveyed 2,263 uk businesses, 1,174 uk registered charities, and 554 education institutions. the re found that "32% of businesses and 24% of charities overall recall any breaches or attacks from the last 12 months." these figures were much higher for "medium businesses (59%), large businesses (69%), and high-income charities with £500,000 or more in annual income (56%)."
 
 
 
 [
 
 11
 
 ]
 
 
 
 yet, although medium or large businesses are more often the victims, since larger companies have generally improved their security over the last decade,
 
 small and midsize businesses
 
 (smbs) have also become increasingly vulnerable as they often "do not have advanced tools to defend the business."
 
 
 
 [
 
 10
 
 ]
 
 
 
 smbs are most likely to be affected by malware, ransomware, phishing,
 
 man-in-the-middle attacks
 
 , and denial-of service (dos) attacks.
 
 
 
 [
 
 10
 
 ]
 
 
 
 
 
 normal internet users are most likely to be affected by untargeted cyberattacks.
 
 
 
 [
 
 12
 
 ]
 
 
 
 these are where attackers indiscriminately target as many devices, services, or users as possible. they do this using techniques that take advantage of the openness of the internet. these strategies mostly include
 
 phishing
 
 ,
 
 ransomware
 
 ,
 
 water holing
 
 and scanning.
 
 
 
 [
 
 12
 
 ]
 
 
 
 
 
 to secure a computer system, it is important to understand the attacks that can be made against it, and these
 
 threats
 
 can typically be classified into one of the following categories:
 
 
 
 backdoor
 
 
 
 [
 
 
 
 edit
 
 
 
 ]
 
 
 
 
 a
 
 backdoor
 
 in a computer system, a
 
 cryptosystem
 
 , or an
 
 algorithm
 
 is any secret method of bypassing normal
 
 authentication
 
 or security controls. these weaknesses may exist for many reasons, including original design or poor configuration.
 
 
 
 [
 
 13
 
 ]
 
 
 
 due to the nature of backdoors, they are of greater concern to companies and databases as opposed to individuals.
 
 
 backdoors may be added by an authorized party to allow some legitimate access or by an attacker for malicious reasons.
 
 criminals
 
 often use
 
 malware
 
 to install backdoors, giving them remote administrative access to a system.
 
 
 
 [
 
 14
 
 ]
 
 
 
 once they have access, cybercriminals can "modify files, steal personal information, install unwanted software, and even take control of the entire computer."
 
 
 
 [
 
 14
 
 ]
 
 
 
 
 
 backdoors can be difficult to detect, as they often remain hidden within the source code or system firmware intimate knowledge of the
 
 operating system
 
 of the computer.
 
 
 
 denial-of-service attack
 
 
 
 [
 
 
 
 edit
 
 
 
 ]
 
 
 
 
 
 denial-of-service attacks
 
 (dos) are designed to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users.
 
 
 
 [
 
 15
 
 ]
 
 
 
 attackers can deny service to individual victims, such as by deliberately entering a wrong password enough consecutive times to cause the victim's account to be locked, or they may overload the capabilities of a machine or network and block all users at once. while a network attack from a single
 
 ip address
 
 can be blocked by adding a new firewall rule, many forms of
 
 distributed denial-of-service
 
 (ddos) attacks are possible, where the attack comes from a large number of points. in this case, defending against these attacks is much more difficult. such attacks can originate from the
 
 zombie computers
 
 of a
 
 botnet
 
 or from a range of other possible techniques, including
 
 distributed reflective denial-of-service
 
 (drdos), where innocent systems are fooled into sending traffic to the victim.
 
 
 
 [
 
 15
 
 ]
 
 
 
 with such attacks, the amplification factor makes the attack easier for the attacker because they have to use little bandwidth themselves. to understand why attackers may carry out these attacks, see the 'attacker motivation' section.
 
 
 
 physical access attacks
 
 
 
 [
 
 
 
 edit
 
 
 
 ]
 
 
 
 
 
 main article:
 
 physical access
 
 
 
 a direct-access attack is when an unauthorized user (an attacker) gains physical access to a computer, most likely to directly copy data from it or steal information.
 
 
 
 [
 
 16
 
 ]
 
 
 
 attackers may also compromise security by making operating system modifications, installing
 
 software worms
 
 ,
 
 keyloggers
 
 ,
 
 covert listening devices
 
 or using wireless microphones. even when the system is protected by standard security measures, these may be bypassed by booting another operating system or tool from a
 
 cd-rom
 
 or other bootable media.
 
 disk encryption
 
 and the
 
 trusted platform module
 
 standard are designed to prevent these attacks.
 
 
 direct service attackers are related in concept to
 
 direct memory attacks
 
 which allow an attacker to gain direct access to a computer's memory.
 
 
 
 [
 
 17
 
 ]
 
 
 
 the attacks "take advantage of a feature of modern computers that allows certain devices, such as external hard drives, graphics cards, or network cards, to access the computer's memory directly."

 eavesdropping
 
 
 
 [
 
 
 
 edit
 
 
 
 ]
 
 
 
 
 
 eavesdropping
 
 is the act of surreptitiously listening to a private computer conversation (communication), usually between hosts on a network. it typically occurs when a user connects to a network where traffic is not secured or encrypted and sends sensitive business data to a colleague, which, when listened to by an attacker, could be exploited.
 
 
 
 [
 
 18
 
 ]
 
 
 
 data transmitted across an
 
 open network
 
 allows an attacker to exploit a vulnerability and intercept it via various methods.
 
 
 unlike
 
 malware
 
 , direct-access attacks, or other forms of cyber attacks, eavesdropping attacks are unlikely to negatively affect the performance of networks or devices, making them difficult to notice.
 
 
 
 [
 
 18
 
 ]
 
 
 
 in fact, "the attacker does not need to have any ongoing connection to the software at all. the attacker can insert the software onto a compromised device, perhaps by direct insertion or perhaps by a virus or other malware, and then come back some time later to retrieve any data that is found or trigger the software to send the data at some determined time."
 
 
 
 [
 
 19
 
 ]
 
 
 
 
 
 using a
 
 virtual private network
 
 (vpn), which encrypts data between two points, is one of the most common forms of protection against eavesdropping. using the best form of encryption possible for wireless networks is best practice, as well as using
 
 https
 
 instead of an unencrypted
 
 http
 
 .
 
 
 
 [
 
 20
 
 ]
 
 
 
 
 
 programs such as
 
 carnivore
 
 and
 
 narusinsight
 
 have been used by the
 
 federal bureau of investigation
 
 (fbi) and nsa to eavesdrop on the systems of
 
 internet service providers
 
 . even machines that operate as a closed system (i.e., with no contact with the outside world) can be eavesdropped upon by monitoring the faint
 
 electromagnetic
 
 transmissions generated by the hardware.
 
 tempest
 
 is a specification by the nsa referring to these attacks.
 
 
 
 malware
 
 
 
 [
 
 
 
 edit
 
 
 
 ]
 
 
 
 
 malicious software (
 
 malware
 
 ) is any software code or computer program "intentionally written to harm a computer system or its users."
 
 
 
 [
 
 21
 
 ]
 
 
 
 once present on a computer, it can leak sensitive details such as personal information, business information and passwords, can give control of the system to the attacker, and can corrupt or delete data permanently.

 types of malware
 
 
 
 [
 
 
 
 edit
 
 
 
 ]
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 viruses
 
 
 are a specific type of malware, and are normally a malicious code that hijacks software with the intention to "do damage and spread copies of itself." copies are made with the aim to spread to other programs on a computer.
 
 
 
 [
 
 21
 
 ]
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 worms
 
 
 are similar to viruses, however viruses can only function when a user runs (opens) a compromised program. worms are self-replicating malware that spread between programs, apps and devices
 
 without
 
 the need for human interaction.
 
 
 
 [
 
 21
 
 ]
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 trojan horses
 
 
 are programs that pretend to be helpful or hide themselves within desired or legitimate software to "trick users into installing them." once installed, a
 
 rat (remote access trojan)
 
 can create a secret backdoor on the affected device to cause damage.
 
 
 
 [
 
 21
 
 ]
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 spyware
 
 
 is a type of malware that secretly gathers information from an infected computer and transmits the sensitive information back to the
 
 attacker
 
 . one of the most common forms of spyware are
 
 keyloggers
 
 , which record all of a user's keyboard inputs/keystrokes, to "allow hackers to harvest usernames, passwords, bank account and credit card numbers."
 
 
 
 [
 
 21
 
 ]
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 scareware
 
 
 , as the name suggests, is a form of
 
 malware
 
 which uses
 
 social engineering
 
 (manipulation) to scare,
 
 shock
 
 , trigger
 
 anxiety
 
 , or suggest the perception of a threat in order to manipulate users into buying or installing
 
 unwanted software
 
 . these attacks often begin with a "sudden pop-up with an urgent message, usually warning the user that they've broken the law or their device has a virus."
 
 
 
 [
 
 21
 
 ]
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ransomware
 
 
 is when malware installs itself onto a victim's machine, encrypts their files, and then turns around and demands a ransom (usually in
 
 bitcoin
 
 ) to return that data to the user.
 
 
 
 
 man-in-the-middle attacks
 
 
 
 [
 
 
 
 edit
 
 
 
 ]
 
 
 
 
 
 man-in-the-middle attacks
 
 (mitm) involve a malicious attacker trying to intercept, surveil or modify communications between two parties by spoofing one or both party's identities and injecting themselves in-between.
 
 
 
 [
 
 24
 
 ]
 
 
 
 types of mitm attacks include:
 
 
 
 ip address spoofing is where the attacker hijacks routing protocols to reroute the targets traffic to a vulnerable network node for traffic interception or injection.
 
 
 message spoofing (via email, sms or ott messaging) is where the attacker spoofs the identity or carrier service while the target is using messaging protocols like email, sms or ott (ip-based) messaging apps. the attacker can then monitor conversations, launch social attacks or trigger zero-day-vulnerabilities to allow for further attacks.
 
 
 wifi ssid spoofing is where the attacker simulates a wifi base station ssid to capture and modify internet traffic and transactions. the attacker can also use local network addressing and reduced network defenses to penetrate the target's firewall by breaching known vulnerabilities. sometimes known as a pineapple attack thanks to a popular device. see also
 
 malicious association
 
 .
 
 
 
 dns spoofing
 
 is where attackers hijack domain name assignments to redirect traffic to systems under the attackers control, in order to surveil traffic or launch other attacks.
 
 
 ssl hijacking, typically coupled with another media-level mitm attack, is where the attacker spoofs the ssl authentication and encryption protocol by way of certificate authority injection in order to decrypt, surveil and modify traffic. see also

 polymorphic
 
 
 
 [
 
 26
 
 ]
 
 
 
 cyber threats combine several types of attacks and change form to avoid cybersecurity controls as they spread.
 
 
 multi-vector polymorphic attacks, as the name describes, are both multi-vectored and polymorphic.
 
 
 
 [
 
 27
 
 ]
 
 
 
 firstly, they are a singular attack that involves multiple methods of attack. in this sense, they are "multi-vectored (i.e. the attack can use multiple means of propagation such as via the web, email and applications." however, they are also multi-staged, meaning that "they can infiltrate networks and move laterally inside the network."
 
 
 
 [
 
 27
 
 ]
 
 
 
 the attacks can be polymorphic, meaning that the cyberattacks used such as viruses, worms or trojans "constantly change ("morph") making it nearly impossible to detect them using signature-based defences."

 phishing

 an example of a phishing email, disguised as an official
 
 email
 
 from a (
 
 fictional
 
 ) bank. the
 
 sender
 
 is attempting to trick the recipient into revealing
 
 confidential
 
 information by confirming it at the phisher's website. note the misspelling of the words
 
 received
 
 and
 
 discrepancy
 
 as rec
 
 ie
 
 ved and discrep
 
 e
 
 ncy, respectively. although the
 
 url
 
 of the bank's
 
 webpage
 
 appears to be legitimate, the hyperlink points at the phisher's webpage.
 
 
 
 
 phishing
 
 is the attempt of acquiring sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details directly from users by deceiving the users.
 
 
 
 [
 
 28
 
 ]
 
 
 
 phishing is typically carried out by
 
 email spoofing
 
 ,
 
 instant messaging
 
 ,
 
 text message
 
 , or on a
 
 phone
 
 call. they often direct users to enter details at a fake website whose
 
 look and feel
 
 are almost identical to the legitimate one.
 
 
 
 [
 
 29
 
 ]
 
 
 
 the fake website often asks for personal information, such as login details and passwords. this information can then be used to gain access to the individual's real account on the real website.
 
 
 preying on a victim's trust, phishing can be classified as a form of
 
 social engineering
 
 . attackers can use creative ways to gain access to real accounts. a common scam is for attackers to send fake electronic invoices
 
 
 
 [
 
 30
 
 ]
 
 
 
 to individuals showing that they recently purchased music, apps, or others, and instructing them to click on a link if the purchases were not authorized. a more strategic type of phishing is spear-phishing which leverages personal or organization-specific details to make the attacker appear like a trusted source. spear-phishing attacks target specific individuals, rather than the broad net cast by phishing attempts.

 privilege escalation
 
 
 
 [
 
 
 
 edit

 privilege escalation
 
 describes a situation where an attacker with some level of restricted access is able to, without authorization, elevate their privileges or access level.
 
 
 
 [
 
 32
 
 ]
 
 
 
 for example, a standard computer user may be able to exploit a
 
 vulnerability
 
 in the system to gain access to restricted data; or even become
 
 
 root
 
 
 and have full unrestricted access to a system. the severity of attacks can range from attacks simply sending an unsolicited email to a
 
 ransomware attack
 
 on large amounts of data. privilege escalation usually starts with
 
 social engineering
 
 techniques, often
 
 phishing
 
 .
 
 
 
 [
 
 32
 
 ]
 
 
 
 
 
 privilege escalation can be separated into two strategies, horizontal and vertical privilege escalation:
 
 
 
 horizontal escalation (or account takeover) is where an attacker gains access to a normal user account that has relatively low-level privileges. this may be through stealing the user's username and password. once they have access, they have gained a
 
 foothold
 
 , and using this foothold the attacker then may move around the network of users at this same lower level, gaining access to information of this similar privilege.
 
 
 
 [
 
 32
 
 ]
 
 
 
 
 
 vertical escalation however targets people higher up in a company and often with more administrative power, such as an employee in it with a higher privilege. using this privileged account will then enable the attacker to invade other accounts.

 main article:
 
 side-channel attack
 
 
 
 any computational system affects its environment in some form. this effect it has on its environment can range from electromagnetic radiation, to residual effect on ram cells which as a consequence make a
 
 cold boot attack
 
 possible, to hardware implementation faults that allow for access or guessing of other values that normally should be inaccessible. in side-channel attack scenarios, the attacker would gather such information about a system or network to guess its internal state and as a result access the information which is assumed by the victim to be secure. the target information in a side channel can be challenging to detect due to its low amplitude when combined with other signals

 spoofing attack
 
 
 
 spoofing is an act of pretending to be a valid entity through the falsification of data (such as an ip address or username), in order to gain access to information or resources that one is otherwise unauthorized to obtain. spoofing is closely related to
 
 phishing
 
 .
 
 
 
 [

 there are several types of spoofing, including:
 
 
 
 
 email spoofing
 
 , is where an attacker forges the sending (
 
 from
 
 , or source) address of an email.
 
 
 
 ip address spoofing
 
 , where an attacker alters the source ip address in a
 
 network packet
 
 to hide their identity or impersonate another computing system.
 
 
 
 mac spoofing
 
 , where an attacker modifies the
 
 media access control (mac) address
 
 of their
 
 network interface controller
 
 to obscure their identity, or to pose as another.
 
 
 
 biometric
 
 spoofing, where an attacker produces a fake biometric sample to pose as another user.
 
 
 
 [
 
 39
 
 ]
 
 
 
 
 
 
 address resolution protocol
 
 (arp) spoofing, where an attacker sends spoofed address resolution protocol onto a
 
 local area network
 
 to associate their
 
 media access control address
 
 with a different host's ip address. this causes data to be sent to the attacker rather than the intended host.

 employee behavior can have a big impact on
 
 information security
 
 in organizations. cultural concepts can help different segments of the organization work effectively or work against effectiveness toward information security within an organization. information security culture is the "...totality of patterns of behavior in an organization that contributes to the protection of information of all kinds."
 
 
 
 [

 andersson and reimers (2014) found that employees often do not see themselves as part of their organization's information security effort and often take actions that impede organizational changes.
 
 
 
 [

 re shows information security culture needs to be improved continuously. in "information security culture from analysis to change", authors commented, "it's a never-ending process, a cycle of evaluation and change or maintenance." to manage the information security culture, five steps should be taken: pre-evaluation, strategic planning, operative planning, implementation, and post-evaluation.
 
 
 
 [
 
 47
 
 ]
 
 
 
 
 
 
 pre-evaluation: to identify the awareness of information security within employees and to analyze the current security policies.
 
 
 strategic planning: to come up with a better awareness program, clear targets need to be set. assembling a team of skilled professionals is helpful to achieve it.
 
 
 operative planning: a good security culture can be established based on internal communication, management buy-in, security awareness and a training program.
 
 
 
 [
 
 47

 implementation: four stages should be used to implement the information security culture. they are:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 commitment of the management
 
 
 communication with organizational members
 
 
 courses for all organizational members
 
 
 commitment of the employees

 security by design

 main article:
 
 secure by design
 
 
 
 security by design, or alternately secure by design, means that the software has been designed from the ground up to be secure. in this case, security is considered a main feature.
 
 
 the uk government's national cyber security centre separates secure cyber design principles into five sections:
 
 
 
 [
 
 51
 
 ]
 
 
 
 
 
 
 before a secure system is created or updated, companies should ensure they understand the fundamentals and the context around the system they are trying to create and identify any weaknesses in the system.
 
 
 companies should design and centre their security around techniques and defences which make attacking their data or systems inherently more challenging for attackers.
 
 
 companies should ensure that their core services that rely on technology are protected so that the systems are essentially never down.
 
 
 although systems can be created which are safe against a multitude of attacks, that does not mean that attacks will not be attempted. despite one's security, all companies' systems should aim to be able to detect and spot attacks as soon as they occur to ensure the most effective response to them.
 
 
 companies should create secure systems designed so that any attack that is successful has minimal severity.
 
 
 
 these design principles of security by design can include some of the following techniques:
 
 
 
 the
 
 principle of least privilege
 
 , where each part of the system has only the privileges that are needed for its function. that way, even if an
 
 attacker
 
 gains access to that part, they only have limited access to the whole system.
 
 
 
 automated theorem proving
 
 to prove the correctness of crucial software subsystems.
 
 
 
 code reviews
 
 and
 
 unit testing
 
 , approaches to make modules more secure where formal correctness proofs are not possible.
 
 
 
 defense in depth
 
 , where the design is such that more than one subsystem needs to be violated to compromise the integrity of the system and the information it holds.
 
 
 default secure settings, and design to
 
 fail secure
 
 rather than
 
 fail insecure
 
 (see
 
 fail-safe
 
 for the equivalent in
 
 safety engineering
 
 ). ideally, a secure system should require a deliberate, conscious, knowledgeable and free decision on the part of legitimate authorities in order to make it insecure.
 
 
 
 audit trails
 
 track system activity so that when a security breach occurs, the mechanism and extent of the breach can be determined. storing audit trails remotely, where they can only be appended to, can keep intruders from covering their tracks.
 
 
 
 full disclosure
 
 of all vulnerabilities, to ensure that the
 
 window of vulnerability
 
 is kept as short as possible when bugs are discovered.
 
 
 
 
 security architecture
 
 
 
 [
 
 
 
 edit
 
 
 
 ]
 
 
 
 
 security architecture can be defined as the "practice of designing computer systems to achieve security goals."
 
 
 
 [
 
 52
 
 ]
 
 
 
 these goals have overlap with the principles of "security by design" explored above, including to "make initial compromise of the system difficult," and to "limit the impact of any compromise."
 
 
 
 [
 
 52
 
 ]
 
 
 
 in practice, the role of a security architect would be to ensure the structure of a system reinforces the security of the system, and that new changes are safe and meet the security requirements of the organization.
 
 
 
 [
 
 53
 
 ]
 
 
 
 
 
 
 [
 
 54
 
 ]
 
 
 
 
 
 similarly, techopedia defines security architecture as "a unified security design that addresses the necessities and potential risks involved in a certain scenario or environment. it also specifies when and where to apply security controls. the design process is generally reproducible." the key attributes of security architecture are:
 
 
 
 [
 
 55
 
 ]
 
 
 
 
 
 
 the relationship of different components and how they depend on each other.
 
 
 determination of controls based on risk assessment, good practices, finances, and legal matters.
 
 
 the standardization of controls.
 
 
 
 practicing security architecture provides the right foundation to systematically address business, it and security concerns in an organization.

 a state of computer security is the conceptual ideal, attained by the use of three processes: threat prevention, detection, and response. these processes are based on various policies and system components, which include the following:
 
 
 
 limiting the access of individuals using
 
 user account
 
 
 access controls
 
 and using
 
 cryptography
 
 can protect systems files and data, respectively.
 
 
 
 firewalls
 
 are by far the most common prevention systems from a network security perspective as they can (if properly configured) shield access to internal network services and block certain kinds of attacks through packet filtering. firewalls can be both hardware and software-based. firewalls monitor and control incoming and outgoing traffic of a computer network and establish a barrier between a trusted network and an untrusted network.
 
 
 
 [
 
 56
 
 ]
 
 
 
 
 
 
 intrusion detection system
 
 (ids) products are designed to detect network attacks in-progress and assist in post-attack
 
 forensics
 
 , while
 
 audit trails
 
 and
 
 logs
 
 serve a similar function for individual systems.
 
 
 
 response
 
 is necessarily defined by the assessed security requirements of an individual system and may cover the range from simple upgrade of protections to notification of
 
 legal
 
 authorities, counter-attacks, and the like. in some special cases, the complete destruction of the compromised system is favored, as it may happen that not all the compromised resources are detected.

 forward web
 
 proxy
 
 solutions can prevent the client to visit malicious web pages and inspect the content before downloading to the client machines.
 
 
 
 today, computer security consists mainly of preventive measures, like
 
 firewalls
 
 or an
 
 exit procedure
 
 . a firewall can be defined as a way of filtering network data between a host or a network and another network, such as the
 
 internet
 
 . they can be implemented as software running on the machine, hooking into the
 
 network stack
 
 (or, in the case of most
 
 unix
 
 -based operating systems such as
 
 linux
 
 , built into the operating system
 
 kernel
 
 ) to provide real-time filtering and blocking.
 
 
 
 [
 
 56
 
 ]
 
 
 
 another implementation is a so-called
 
 physical firewall
 
 , which consists of a separate machine filtering network traffic. firewalls are common amongst machines that are permanently connected to the internet.
 
 
 some organizations are turning to
 
 big data
 
 platforms, such as
 
 apache hadoop
 
 , to extend data accessibility and
 
 machine learning
 
 to detect
 
 advanced persistent threats
 
 .
 
 
 
 [
 
 58
 
 ]
 
 
 
 
 
 in order to ensure adequate security, the confidentiality, integrity and availability of a network, better known as the cia triad, must be protected and is considered the foundation to information security.
 
 
 
 [
 
 59
 
 ]
 
 
 
 to achieve those objectives, administrative, physical and technical security measures should be employed. the amount of security afforded to an asset can only be determined when its value is known.

 vulnerability management

 main article:
 
 vulnerability management
 
 
 
 vulnerability management is the cycle of identifying, fixing or mitigating
 
 vulnerabilities
 
 ,
 
 
 
 [
 
 61
 
 ]
 
 
 
 especially in software and
 
 firmware
 
 . vulnerability management is integral to computer security and
 
 network security
 
 .
 
 
 vulnerabilities can be discovered with a
 
 vulnerability scanner
 
 , which analyzes a computer system in  of known vulnerabilities,
 
 
 
 [
 
 62
 
 ]
 
 
 
 such as
 
 open ports
 
 , insecure software configuration, and susceptibility to
 
 malware
 
 . in order for these tools to be effective, they must be kept up to date with every new update the vendor release. typically, these updates will scan for the new vulnerabilities that were introduced recently.
 
 
 beyond vulnerability scanning, many organizations contract outside security auditors to run regular
 
 penetration tests
 
 against their systems to identify vulnerabilities. in some sectors, this is a contractual requirement.

 reducing vulnerabilities
 
 
 
 [
 
 
 
 edit
 
 
 
 ]
 
 
 
 
 the act of assessing and reducing vulnerabilities to cyber attacks is commonly referred to as
 
 information technology security assessments
 
 . they aim to assess systems for risk and to predict and test for their vulnerabilities. while
 
 formal verification
 
 of the correctness of computer systems is possible,
 
 
 
 [
 
 64
 
 ]
 
 
 
 
 
 
 [
 
 65
 
 ]
 
 
 
 it is not yet common. operating systems formally verified include

 and
 
 sysgo

 [

 – but these make up a very small percentage of the market.
 
 
 it is possible to reduce an attacker's chances by keeping systems up to date with security patches and updates and by hiring people with expertise in security. large companies with significant threats can hire security operations centre (soc) analysts. these are specialists in cyber defences, with their role ranging from "conducting threat analysis to investigating reports of any new issues and preparing and testing disaster recovery plans."
 
 
 
 [
 
 69
 
 ]
 
 
 
 
 
 whilst no measures can completely guarantee the prevention of an attack, these measures can help mitigate the damage of possible attacks. the effects of data loss/damage can be also reduced by careful
 
 backing up
 
 and
 
 insurance
 
 .
 
 
 outside of formal assessments, there are various methods of reducing vulnerabilities.
 
 two factor authentication
 
 is a method for mitigating unauthorized access to a system or sensitive information.
 
 
 
 [
 
 70
 
 ]
 
 
 
 it requires
 
 something you know:
 
 a password or pin, and
 
 something you have
 
 : a card, dongle, cellphone, or another piece of hardware. this increases security as an unauthorized person needs both of these to gain access.
 
 
 protecting against social engineering and direct computer access (physical) attacks can only happen by non-computer means, which can be difficult to enforce, relative to the sensitivity of the information. training is often involved to help mitigate this risk by improving people's knowledge of how to protect themselves and by increasing people's awareness of threats.
 
 
 
 [
 
 71
 
 ]
 
 
 
 however, even in highly disciplined environments (e.g. military organizations), social engineering attacks can still be difficult to foresee and prevent.
 
 
 inoculation, derived from
 
 inoculation theory
 
 , seeks to prevent social engineering and other fraudulent tricks and traps by instilling a resistance to persuasion attempts through exposure to similar or related attempts.

 computer security compromised by hardware failure
 
 
 
 hardware-based or assisted computer security also offers an alternative to software-only computer security. using devices and methods such as
 
 dongles
 
 ,
 
 trusted platform modules
 
 , intrusion-aware cases, drive locks, disabling usb ports, and mobile-enabled access may be considered more secure due to the physical access (or sophisticated backdoor access) required in order to be compromised. each of these is covered in more detail below.
 
 
 
 usb
 
 dongles
 
 are typically used in software licensing schemes to unlock software capabilities,
 
 
 
 [
 
 73
 
 ]
 
 
 
 but they can also be seen as a way to prevent unauthorized access to a computer or other device's software. the dongle, or key, essentially creates a secure encrypted tunnel between the software application and the key. the principle is that an encryption scheme on the dongle, such as
 
 advanced encryption standard
 
 (aes) provides a stronger measure of security since it is harder to hack and replicate the dongle than to simply copy the native software to another machine and use it. another security application for dongles is to use them for accessing web-based content such as cloud software or
 
 virtual private networks
 
 (vpns).
 
 
 
 [
 
 74
 
 ]
 
 
 
 in addition, a usb dongle can be configured to lock or unlock a computer.
 
 
 
 [
 
 75
 
 ]
 
 
 
 
 
 
 trusted platform modules
 
 (tpms) secure devices by integrating cryptographic capabilities onto access devices, through the use of microprocessors, or so-called computers-on-a-chip. tpms used in conjunction with server-side software offer a way to detect and authenticate hardware devices, preventing unauthorized network and data access.
 
 
 
 [
 
 76
 
 ]
 
 
 
 
 
 
 computer case intrusion detection
 
 refers to a device, typically a push-button switch, which detects when a computer case is opened. the firmware or bios is programmed to show an alert to the operator when the computer is booted up the  time.
 
 
 drive locks are essentially software tools to encrypt hard drives, making them inaccessible to thieves.
 
 
 
 [
 
 77
 
 ]
 
 
 
 tools exist specifically for encrypting external drives as well.
 
 
 
 [
 
 78
 
 ]
 
 
 
 
 
 disabling usb ports is a security option for preventing unauthorized and malicious access to an otherwise secure computer. infected usb dongles connected to a network from a computer inside the firewall are considered by the magazine network world as the most common hardware threat facing computer networks.
 
 
 disconnecting or disabling peripheral devices (like camera, gps, removable storage, etc.), that are not in use.
 
 
 
 [
 
 79
 
 ]
 
 
 
 
 
 mobile-enabled access devices are growing in popularity due to the ubiquitous nature of cell phones.
 
 
 
 [
 
 80
 
 ]
 
 
 
 built-in capabilities such as
 
 bluetooth
 
 , the newer
 
 bluetooth low energy
 
 (le),
 
 near-field communication
 
 (nfc) on non-ios devices and
 
 biometric
 
 validation such as thumbprint readers, as well as
 
 qr code
 
 reader software designed for mobile devices, offer new, secure ways for mobile phones to connect to access control systems. these control systems provide computer security and can also be used for controlling access to secure buildings.
